# Case Study #2: Foodie Fi - Outside The Box Questions & Solutions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study.  There are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective.
Make an amazing impression!

## 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
### Explanation
For subscription businesses, the main pillars
of growth are the number of customers acquired and 
retained.  It is paramount to foster strong customer
relationships to protect the company's future.  This
is why comparing the customer acquisition rate over 
different time scopes can provide an accurate 
description of the company's growth rate.  A good 
practice is to break down the total number of 
customers acquired this year, last year, this month,
last month, today, and yesterday.  It could also 
benefit leadership to see both the total numbers and
the active customer numbers to find trends over time.

A common way to calculate the monthly growth rates is to 
calculate subscribers on the last day of the month 
minus the number of subscribers on the first day of
the month, and divide this difference by the
subscribers on the first day of the month.


## 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
### Explanation
There are several important metrics that
can help leadership understand Foodie-Fi's performance
over time:

1. The customer lifetime value can tell us
the total revenue potential from one customer.  
2. The renewal rate can tell us if customers value 
the content and services we provide.
3. The monthly recurring revenue can tell us the 
monthly revenue for a subscription. We can also
capture the yearly recurring revenue.     


## 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
### Explanation
I would love to analyze the following
customer journeys or experiences:

1. Onboarding: this is a critical point of the journey
because customers are first introduced to our products
and services.  Do we do a good enough job explaining
Foodie-Fi's content capabilities?  Do we provide 
excellent customer service when customers contact us?

2. Customer Feedback: businesses with a subscription
model must do a good job of listening to the customers
to continue to receive future revenues.  How do we
ask for customer feedback?  What is the response rate 
of these communication efforts?  Do customer responses
change over time, or vary by plan category?

3. Promotional Efforts: we must engage potential new
customers and show them how Foodie-Fi can provide
valuable content to them.  How do we contact them?
What communication methods do we use?  When do we
contact them?


## 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
### Explanation
These are some of the exit survey questions
I would include:

1. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would rate the content 
on our platform?

2. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would rate our customer 
service staff?

3. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would rate the variety
of content on our platform?

4. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would rate the speed at 
which new content is uploaded to our platform?


## 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
### Explanation
These are some of the levers Foodie-Fi 
could use to reduce customer churn rate:

1. Define the user roadmap for new users.

2. Routine customer surveys to ask for customer feedback.

3. Offer retention incentives. 

4. Target the right customers.
