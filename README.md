## Project Overview
* Answered several business intelligence-related questions posed by leadership regarding each company's performance.
* Created several MySQL scripts to upload and pre-process the data, perform a thorough exploratory and explanatory analysis, and built several pivot tables to write business reports.
* Created a MySQL script to highlight key SQL skills like rank functions, common table expressions, temporary tables, and case statements.
* Set up a database and SQL editor to interact with the database, upload the schema, and dump tables.

## Code and Resources Used
**MySQL Version:** 8.0.31

## About the Project
Danny Ma is a Principal AI Engineer at LUMOS.  He wanted to create a online community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey. Thus, the 8 Week SQL Challenge was created.  

By completing the challenge, I sharpened my SQL skills by doing through multiple realistic end to end case studies that closely represent the sort of work performed by data analysts.  The datasets and case studies in this course gave me experience in the following domains:

* Health analytics
* Marketing analytics
* People analytics
* Financial markets
* Fast moving consumer goods
* Digital marketing

## Core SQL Skills Covered
Here are a few of the core SQL skills and techniques required to complete the challenge:

|  <!-- --> | <!-- -->  | <!-- -->  |  <!-- --> |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where filters and ordering data  | Group by aggregates  | Identifying and dealing with duplicate data  | Common table expressions and subqueries   |
| Summary statistics  | Exploratory data analysis  | Complex table joins  | Entity relationship diagrams  |
| SQL reverse engineering  | Data problem solving techniques  | All the window functions  | Case When Statements  |
| Recursive CTEs  | Cumulative aggregates  | Simple, weighted and exponential moving metrics  | Historical vs Snapshot data analysis techniques  |
